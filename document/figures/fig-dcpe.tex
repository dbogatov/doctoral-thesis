		Schematic description of encryption process of \acrshort{dcpe}, drawn to scale.
		In this diagram, there are two dimensions ($d = 2$), $\beta$ is 2 units, and $s$ is a factor of 2.
		The encrypted point is uniformly sampled inside a $\beta$-ball, then scaled $s$ times.
		If two points are too close, their circles intersect, and their encryptions can be sampled in a way that breaks distance comparison.
		Intuitively, larger $\beta$ implies greater ciphertext space for a point and greater security.
