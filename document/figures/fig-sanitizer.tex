		An example of a hierarchical sanitizer \cite{hierarchical-methods-for-dp} with fanout $\fanout = 2$.
		Left (red) value is noise and right (green) value is the number of records covered by the node.
		To answer a query $[3, 28]$, we take only two nodes $(4 + 25)$ and $(4 + 10)$ with a resulting noise of 8 and 35 real records.
