\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

	In this paper, we present a system called \epsolute{} that can be used to store and retrieve encrypted records in the cloud while providing strong and provable security guarantees, and that exhibits excellent query performance for range and point queries.
	We use an optimized Oblivious RAM protocol that has been parallelized together with very efficient Differentially Private sanitizers that hide both the access patterns and the exact communication volume sizes and can withstand advanced attacks that have been recently developed.
	We provide a prototype of the system and present an extensive evaluation over very large and diverse datasets and workloads that show excellent performance for the given security guarantees.

	In our future work, we plan to investigate methods to extend our approaches to use a trusted execution environment (\acrshort{tee}), like \acrshort{sgx}, in order to improve the performance even further.
	We will also explore a multi-user setting without the need for a shared stateful client, and enabling dynamic workloads with insertions and updates.
	We will also consider how adaptive and non-adaptive security models would change in the case of dynamic environments.
	One would presumably also require \acrshort{dp} of the server's view in this setting.
	Lastly, we plan to explore other relational operations like \texttt{JOIN} and \texttt{GROUP BY}.
