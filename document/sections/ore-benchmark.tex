\chapter{Range queries in a snapshot model}\label{section:range-queries-snapshot}
\thispagestyle{myheadings}

	One of the ways to run a range query in a presence of a snapshot adversary is to use a conventional database range index, such as \BPlus{} tree~\cite{b-tree}, and encrypt the values in the index in a way that preserves their comparison result.
	This is exactly what \gls{ope} does.
	\gls{ope} is a scheme, a tuple of algorithms \algo{OPE.KeyGen}, \algo{OPE.Enc} and \algo{OPE.Dec}, that generate a kay, encrypt and decrypt a number respectively with a property that if $x$ was smaller, greater or equal to $y$, then their respective ciphertexts will maintain the relation.
	\gls{ore} works similarly except that the ciphertexts are not necessarily numbers and a comparison is an explicit algorithm \algo{ORE.Cmp} over hte ciphertexts.
	Formally, \gls{ope} is a specific \gls{ore} where ciphertexts are numbers and comparison is trivial, therefore, in this work I will only refer to \gls{ore}.

	Security of an \gls{ore} scheme is typically defined as via security game and a leakage profile \cite{practical-ore}.
	The scheme is defined secure with a leakage \leakage{} if there exists a simulator that can use the leakage function and can generate output indistinguishable from the one generated by the real scheme \cite{ore-benchmark-17}.
	The leakage function, ranging from as much as half of the bits of input to as little as an equality pattern of the most-significant differing bit of two inputs, is the defining security level of a scheme.

	In the comparative evaluation work \cite{ore-benchmark-17}, I choose five \gls{ore} scheme and analyze them under common framework.
	For each of the schemes I identify how many times it uses which cryptographic or expensive algebraic primitives, such as PRG or samplers, its ciphertext or state size and, its leakage profile.
	I deliberately do not account wall-clock execution time as this value is highly dependent on hardware and primitive implementations and is, therefore, not representative.
	Below I concisely describe the schemes and give a summary of my finding in \cref{table:ore}.
