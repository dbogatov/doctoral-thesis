\section*{\centerline{Dedication}}

	I dedicate my dissertation work to my wife, my parents and the brave defenders of Ukraine.
	Dasha, love of my life, thank you for supporting me since the very first day of the program, through the long distance, once-in-a-century world-wide health crisis and the war.
	It was with your help that I was able to come so far.
	A special feeling of gratitude to my loving parents, Kostiantyn and Nataliia, whose help early in my academic career was critical and enabled my doctorate program in the first place, and whose support never waned to this day.
	Lastly, my heart and my thoughts go to the brave people of Ukraine, who are heroically defending the motherland from Russian invasion with their lives.
	We are with you, physically and virtually, in Lviv and Mariupol, in Kharkiv and in Kyiv.
	My sincere hope, my wish, is that this work will contribute, however little, to the cause of my beloved nation.
	Слава Україні!
