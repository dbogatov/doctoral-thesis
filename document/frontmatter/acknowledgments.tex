\section*{\centerline{Acknowledgments}}

	First and foremost, I want to thank my advisor, George Kollios, for his guidance and continued support throughout my doctorate journey, from the day he accepted me to his lab to this day.
	I am honored to call him and his family my friends.
	I also thank Leo Reyzin for the time and effort he spent helping me with my work, and for the many cups of coffee and long life talks we have had over these years.
	I want to especially note the many hours-long philosophical discussions with Manos Athanassoulis --- the discussions I truly enjoyed.
	In the heat of the our debates we have lived up to the Ph.\ part of our degrees.
	My special thanks go to Adam O'Neil for his countless contributions to my works.
	He has been an invaluable co-author, contributor, reviewer and friend.

	I would like to express my gratitude to my closest ally in this life, my beloved wife, Daria Bogatova.
	There is not a single piece fo writing I did without your review, not a single figure I crafted without your keen eye refining the tiniest details, from fonts to colors.
	Even the source code of this very thesis has been branched off of your work Bachelor work \cite{dasha-thesis}.
	You are the first to listen to my ideas, and the first to support them unconditionally.
