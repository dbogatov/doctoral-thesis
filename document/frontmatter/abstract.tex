As organizations struggle with processing vast amounts of information, outsourcing sensitive data to third parties becomes a necessity.
To protect the data, various cryptographic techniques are used in outsourced database systems to ensure data privacy while allowing efficient querying.

In this prospectus, I propose a definition and components of a new secure and efficient outsourced database system, which answers various types of queries, with different privacy guarantees in different security models.
I start with my survey work on five order-preserving and order-revealing encryption schemes that can be used directly in many database indices, like the B+ tree, and five range query protocols with various trade-offs in terms of security and efficiency.
This work systematizes the state-of-the-art range query solutions in a snapshot adversary setting and offers some non-obvious observations regarding the efficiency of the constructions.
I then follow with a recently published work, \epsolute{}, an efficient range query engine in a persistent adversary model.
In this work, we achieve security in a setting with a much stronger adversary where she can continuously observe everything on the server, and leaking even the result size can enable a reconstruction attack.
We propose a definition, construction, analysis and experimental evaluation of a system that provably hides both access pattern and communication volume, while remaining efficient.
Finally, I describe an ongoing work on secure \acrlong{knn} queries, in which the security is achieved similarly to \acrshort{ope}/\acrshort{ore} solutions --- encrypting the input with an approximate \acrlong{dcpe} scheme, so that the inputs are perturbed, but the query algorithm still produces accurate results.
